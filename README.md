cs100 software construction course
=====
These solutions covered various homework assignments. The biggest portion of the homework was creating a custom command line shell. The shell is implemented with various POSXI API calls. The shell can run ls, mv, pipes, execute external programs via exec(). The last version of the shell contained basic server/client communication and was able to transfer directories and files via a tcp socket.
